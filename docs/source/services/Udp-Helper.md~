##How to use UdpHelper

This helper allows to start an UDP server listenig on a specific port and send UDP packets to a remote host.

Let's start with an example. We want to add a server listening on port 7777.

First of all create a new helper and start the server specifying ip address, port number and a listener

```java
  UdpHelper udpserver = new UpdHelper();
  udpServer.startServer("0.0.0.0", 7777, new UdpListener() {
            @Override
            public void onDataAvailable(String sourceAddress, Integer sourcePort, String data) {
                System.out.println("UDP packet received: {0}", data);
                // here add the code to execute when a packet is received
            });
```

When a new packet arrives you can see the payload on the log as a string and execute any code added to **onDataAvailable** method.

It'd be better to stop the server and unbound the port with

```java
   udpServer.stop()
```

### How to send a packet

To send a packet you need only the ip and port number of the remote host and a string representing the payload.

For example:

```java
udpServer.send("192.168.0.120", 8899, "payload to send");
```
