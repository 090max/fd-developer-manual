Freedomotic API
===============

Freedomotic exposes its functionalities by `RestAPI v3 plugin <https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/tree/master/plugins/devices/restapi-v3>`_.

It implements a RESTful service based on Jersey and Atmosphere framework. 

So it's possible to create a custom client (not only in Java but in every language can consume a REST service) to interact with our platform.

For more details about the plugin configuration you can visit `this link <http://freedomotic-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/restapi.html>`_.
